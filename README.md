# CurlingWords

If you have a bunch of webpages and you need to find something specific on its content, this tool might help you :) 

This tool can loop on a file with urls on it and extract the ones with an specific word on it.
It only needs two parameters:

-w for the word you want to search
-f for the file you will use

the content from the file should be something like this:

http://10.129.105.112/nibbleblog/admin/controllers/categories/edit.bit
http://10.129.105.112/nibbleblog/admin/views/settings/general.bit
http://10.129.105.112/nibbleblog/admin/controllers/user/forgot.bit
http://10.129.105.112/nibbleblog/admin/controllers/plugins/uninstall.bit
